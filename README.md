# Advanced-JS-Constructor-Hangman

### This is a CLI app using Node.js and the inquirer npm package. Two main constructors are used: word and letter.

##### Initializing node main.js in the command line prompts the user with the word to guess and to input a letter.

##### After the user guesses a letter they are updated with their remaining number of guesses, and the remaining letters to be guessed.

##### Once the user has successfully guessed the correct letters completing the word they are shown "Correct! The word was ___" and the game ends.
